# Assignment-II-Database-Creation-Deletion-OEM-Davina-Gladys-IRIBAGIZA-MUTARUTINYA-29278

- Overview of tasks:

Task1: In task 1, I create a pluggable database named da_pdb_29278 with admin user namde davina_plsqlauca_29278. I was able to complete this task successfully.
Task2: I created another pluggable database named da_to_delete_pdb_29278, and after creating it I closed it and deleted it as it was required. I took screenshots
      for both the creation and deletion of this Pluggable database.
Task 3: I accessed and configured the Oracle Enterprise Manager and took a screenshot of the dashboard.

- Issues faced:

The issue I faced was that i did not know how to use docker to connect it to my oracle sql developer. I solved the issue by watching youtube tutorials on how to install docker, how it functions and how to connect docker and my oracle sql developer.
